# Private Events

Ruby on Rails back end demonstration to simulate some of the functionality of [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/)

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. This requires a many-to-many relationship.

This is part of [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rail's track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
